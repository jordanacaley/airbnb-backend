# Airbnb backend clone

This project uses Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL to build a relational database to recreate the Airbnb backend. There are 4 models: ```User``` who can be a guest or an admin of a listing, ```City``` where the listing is located, ```Listing``` with details about the property, and ```Reservation``` for the individual bookings.

1. Download the code
2. Run ```bundle install``` in your terminal
3. Run ```rails db:seed``` in your terminal to generate a sample database
4. Run ```rails console``` to explore the different relationships
5. Run ```tp NameOfModel.all``` within the console to visualize the data in neat tables
